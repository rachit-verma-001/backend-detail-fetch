Skilled in Film, Creative Concept Design, Art Direction, and Digital Marketing. Strong arts and design professional. A driven UX designer with the creativity and empathy to solve human problems in the digital space. Combining user analysis and design skills to execute the entire UX design process from research to prototyping.My presentation skills, combined with a comprehensive communications background, strategic and business insights, trusted client guidance and leadership allow me to deliver consistent results clients appreciate.Characterized by colleagues and supervisors as personable, energized and competitive with the ability to assimilate knowledge quickly and transform concepts into reality, and a ‘Team Player’ who understands the importance of collaboration and compromise as well as the value in mentoring Mid and Junior Level team members in order to strengthen the team and provide an opportunity for personal growth.As a designer and researcher, I have conducted competitive analysis, created sitemaps, and developed prototypes from low-fidelity mockups to high-fidelity Sketch documents.

Skilled in Film, Creative Concept Design, Art Direction, and Digital Marketing. Strong arts and design professional. A driven UX designer with the creativity and empathy to solve human problems in the digital space. Combining user analysis and design skills to execute the entire UX design process from research to prototyping.My presentation skills, combined with a comprehensive communications background, strategic and business insights, trusted client guidance and leadership allow me to deliver consistent results clients appreciate.Characterized by colleagues and supervisors as personable, energized and competitive with the ability to assimilate knowledge quickly and transform concepts into reality, and a ‘Team Player’ who understands the importance of collaboration and compromise as well as the value in mentoring Mid and Junior Level team members in order to strengthen the team and provide an opportunity for personal growth.As a designer and researcher, I have conducted competitive analysis, created sitemaps, and developed prototypes from low-fidelity mockups to high-fidelity Sketch documents. I have analyzed both qualitative and quantitative data to identify customer friction, and I have conducted user testing to determine the ideal solution to human problems.While I love putting my head down and focusing on deliverable designs, I acknowledge that design serves larger business objectives. To that end, I am constantly seeking better ways to advocate for design that is a win for the business.\n  \n      \n          …\n        \n          see more\n        \n      \n\n\n                \n\n              \n\n                  \n    \n    \n                \n  \n    Activity\n  \n  \n  \n\n\n    \n      1,475 followers\n    \n\n\n  \n      \n            Posts Ambuj created, shared, or commented on in the last 90 days are displayed here.\n              \n  \n\n\n  \n    See all activity\n  \n  \n    See all activity\n  \n\n              \n  \n  \n\n\n              \n              \n                  \n    \n  \n    Experience\n  \n\n\n\n  \n          \n    \n          \n  \n\n\n  User Experience Lead\n  Company Name\n  \n      Protonshub Technologies \n  \n    \n    \n      Dates Employed\n      Jun 2021 – Present\n    \n      \n        Employment Duration\n        5 mos\n      \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n    \n\n  \n\n          \n    \n          \n  \n\n\n  Design Consultant\n  Company Name\n  \n      Shoonya The Studio\n  \n    \n    \n      Dates Employed\n      Feb 2016 – Present\n    \n      \n        Employment Duration\n        5 yrs 9 mos\n      \n  \n\n  \n    Location\n    Indore, Madhya Pradesh, India\n  \n\n\n\n\n    \n\n  \n\n          \n    \n          \n  \n\n\n  User Experience Designer\n  Company Name\n  \n      Gramophone\n  \n    \n    \n      Dates Employed\n      Nov 2018 – May 2021\n    \n      \n        Employment Duration\n        2 yrs 7 mos\n      \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n    \n\n  \n\n          \n    \n          \n  \n\n\n  UI/UX Designer\n  Company Name\n  \n      Consagous Technologies Pvt Ltd\n  \n    \n    \n      Dates Employed\n      Jan 2017 – Nov 2018\n    \n      \n        Employment Duration\n        1 yr 11 mos\n      \n  \n\n  \n    Location\n    Indore, Madhya Pradesh, India\n  \n\n\n\n\n    \n\n  \n\n          \n    \n          \n  \n\n\n  Senior motion Graphic Designer\n  Company Name\n  \n      Big Bang Education\n  \n    \n    \n      Dates Employed\n      Feb 2016 – Jan 2017\n    \n      \n        Employment Duration\n        1 yr\n      \n  \n\n  \n    Location\n    Indore, Madhya Pradesh, India\n  \n\n\n\n\n    \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  Show 2 more experiences\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n  \n\n  \n    \n  \n    Education\n  \n\n\n\n  \n      \n  \n        \n  \n\n\n\n  \n    Delhi University\n\n      \n        Degree Name\n        BA - Bachelor of Arts\n      \n      \n        Field Of Study\n        Design and Applied Arts\n      \n  \n\n    \n      Dates attended or expected graduation\n      \n            2008 – 2011\n      \n    \n\n\n\n  \n\n\n  \n\n\n  \n\n  \n    \n  \n    Licenses & certifications\n  \n\n\n\n\n    \n\n    \n      \n  \n\n\n\n  \n    Launching Your Creative Business\n  \n\n    \n      \n        Issuing authority\n      \n      \n        LinkedIn\n      \n    \n\n    \n      \n        Issued date and, if applicable, expiration date of the certification or license\n      \n      Issued May 2021No Expiration Date\n      \n    \n\n\n    \n\n    \n\n    \n\n    \n\n    \n      \n  \n\n\n\n  \n    UX Deep Dive: Analyzing Data\n  \n\n    \n      \n        Issuing authority\n      \n      \n        LinkedIn\n      \n    \n\n    \n      \n        Issued date and, if applicable, expiration date of the certification or license\n      \n      Issued Mar 2021No Expiration Date\n      \n    \n\n\n    \n\n    \n\n    \n\n    \n\n      \n  \n\n\n\n  \n    C language\n  \n\n    \n      \n        Issuing authority\n      \n      \n        NIIT Technologies Limited\n      \n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n              \n            \n\n\n                \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n            \n\n                \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n          \n        \n      Ambuj Singh\n        \n  \n      2nd degree connection\n  \n  \n    2nd\n  \n\n    \n  \n"], ["image", ""], ["created_at", "2021-10-22 11:38:27.793788"], ["updated_at", "2021-10-22 11:38:27.793788"], ["role_id", 1], ["mobile_no", ""]]

Group,Indore.There is something special when career and passion comes together. Yes! It leads to creativity.  Let's start with a small glimpse to my career history. I have completed my engineering with honors in computer science and engineering branch in Acropolis institute of Technology & Research.A student with an unprofessional life was my real attitude towards theme to live until I got to know my passion. When I realised I can't go back and change the beginning but can definitely start where I am and change the ending. A passion in one hand and spirit to work in another I marched forward with my selection to a first company Systango (Where I had my best time). There I met a genuine leader whose actions inspired me to learn more, do more and become more. I believe to be a person who gets influenced by determination and persistence rather than a title or a designation.  I step forwarded with a new Organization Diaspark Infotech Pvt Ltd . I learned but my instinct for a higher standard didn't let me to be at peace . That's when I decided to be a torch bearer of my dreams and opt to my startup company.Dear friends! Each one of us can make a difference with a simple rule -\"No excuses to yourself because reality is wrong and dreams are real \"I have very big ambition to build the biggest ecosystem in a town which helps us to grow our careers and build a stronger network.

If you have worked with class-based components, we would have used those methods for updating the DOM, fetching data using an API endpoint, etc. React Component Lifecycle - Basically there are 3 phases of the React component lifecycle - Mounting - Inserting the component into the DOM Updating - Updating the component in the DOM Unmounting - Detaching the component out of DOM All the 3 phases have there respective methods which make it easy to work with the components and perform certain operations. In Class-Based Components, we can directly access those methods since we extend React.Component class. Mounting - This is the first phase of the lifecycle. In this phase, the component is created and inserted into the DOM. In this phase, we have componentDidMount() method. This method is called just after the component is mounted. In this method, we can use setState() to modify and set the state - Updating - This is the second phase and it happens after the component is mounted and rendered. When the props and states are changed, the component is updated. Here we have componentDidUpdate().This method also allows us to modify and set state but make sure to wrap it with some condition to avoid the infinite loop - Unmounting - This is the third phase and it happens just before the component is removed or detached from the DOM. Here we have the method called componentWillUnmount(). This method is called just before the component is unmounted - So how to use these methods in a Functional component? To perform similar actions, useEffect hook is introduced. The useEffect Hook - Hooks are the new addition in React 16.8. Hooks help us to use other features and state without actually writing a class. The useEffect hook takes 2 parameters - a callback function and an array also called effect dependency array. The callback function is called every time the component is mounted and unmounted. If we want to restrict this, we have the dependency array in which we pass dependencies and the Hook will only run if any of those dependencies changes. useEffect as componentDidMount() - We can easily make useEffect Hook work similarly as the componentDidMount() method by just passing the callback function inside the Hook - Pretty easy, right? useEffect as componentDidUpdate() - If we want to make useEffect Hook work like componentDidUpdate(), we can easily do it by just passing the second parameter, i.e., dependency array. When we pass the dependencies, the useEffect Hook will only run when the values changes. Let's see how - Here, we have passed selectedValue inside the dependency array. Now, useEffect Hook will only run if the value of selectedValue changes. Same as the above but with a little change. useEffect as componentWillUnmount() - As we already know that just before the component is unmounted from the DOM, componentWillUnmount() method is called. To make useEffect Hook work like this method, we need to return a cleanup function inside the Hook - If we want to run the cleanup function only when the component is unmounted from the DOM, we need to set the dependency array as empty. If we pass dependencies in the array, the cleanup function will run every time the value of dependencies changes. All the cases combined - So, we can now easily perform side effects using Hooks. We have seen that it is very simple to run our code on specific phases like mounting, unmounting, etc. with the help of useEffect Hook. Conclusion - We have learned about the phases of the component lifecycle in React and how to use lifecycle methods in a function-based component using useEffect Hook.\n  \n\n\n      \n  \n\n  \n    \n    \n      \n    \n            19\n      \n    \n\n    \n      \n          \n            2 comments\n          \n      \n    \n\n\n\n\n  \n\n          \n  \n\n\n\n\n                        \n    \n      \n        \n    \n      \n    \n      \n\n  \n    \n\n  \n      \n          Pure Components in React\n\n\n      \n\n      \n          Devesh Lashkari on LinkedIn\n\n\n      \n      \n        \n\n    If you have ever worked on React, you would have heard about pure components at least once. So what are pure components? How are they different from regular components? In this article, we will learn about what are they and how they are different from a regular component. But before that, we have to learn about Pure Functions in Javascript. Pure Functions in Javascript - A function that returns the same output if same arguements are passed in it. It does not depend on any change in data or state during the program's execution. For example, const addValues = (x, y) => { return x + y } // Pure FunctionaddValues(2,10); // 12  addValues is a pure function as its output depends on the arguments provided. It will always give the same output. Now that we got an idea about pure functions, let's learn about Pure Components in React. Pure Components in React - We all know that React is a component-based javascript framework. Pure components in React are the same as regular components but with a twist. Let's take an example to learn about them. Create 3 components i.e. Parent.js, Regular.js, and Pure.js. The Parent.js will have Regular.js and Pure.js as a child and all of them are class-based components. Let's create all the 3 components. Parent.js import React, { Component } from \"react\";import Regular from \"./Regular\";import Pure from \"./Pure\";class Parent extends Component {        constructor(props) {       super(props);       this.state = {         name: 'Devesh',       };    }    componentDidMount = () => {            setInterval(() => {           this.setState({ name:\"Devesh\" });                     }, 3000)    }   render() {    console.log(\" *****Parent Component***** \");    return (      <Regular name={this.state.name} />      <Pure name={this.state.name} />    );  }}export default Parent; Note that, our Parent component is having a state called name with the value \"Devesh\". We are passing the state as a prop in both of the components. Also, in the componentDidMount lifecycle method, we have used a setInterval method which will update the state with the same value i.e., \"Devesh\" in the interval of 3 seconds. We are also using console.log() inside the render method. Regular.js import React, { Component } from \"react\";class Regular extends Component {   render() {     console.log(\" *****Regular Component***** \");    return (      <div>{this.props.name}</div>    );  }}export default Regular; Pure.js import React, { PureComponent } from \"react\";class Pure extends PureComponent {   render() {    console.log(\" *****Pure Component***** \");    return (      <div>{this.props.name}</div>    );  }}export default Pure; Note that, in Pure Component, we have import PureComponent class instead of Component and extending the same. Now, import Parent Component in App.js. App.js import React, { Component } from \"react\";import Parent from \"./Parent\";class App extends Component {   render() {    return (      <Parent />    );  }}export default App; When you run the code, you will see something like this - As you can see, our HTML is displayed normally but when you look at the console there is a difference. Pure Component is printed when the first time the Parent component is rendered but not after the setState method called and updates the state in setInterval function after 3 seconds. It will be rendered unless we return false in shouldComponentUpdate method. But why? What happened here? If you have noticed, instead of importing Component class in Pure Component, we have imported the PureComponent class. This is where things changed. So, let's see what is the difference between regular component class and pure component class - Regular Component - It does not implement shouldComponentUpdate method and always returns true by default. Pure Component - It implements shouldComponentUpdate method with a shallow comparison of props and state. Shallow Comparison - Now, what exactly is this shallow comparison of props and state? Let's take a look at it - We can learn about shallow comparisons using primitive data types and complex data types. Primitive (Integer, String, Boolean, etc. ) - x (SC) y returns true if both x and y have the same value and same data types. For example - Integer 1 (SC) Integer 1 returns trueInteger 1 (SC) String `Devesh` returns false Complex (Arrays, Objects, etc. ) - x (SC) y returns true if both x and y reference the same object. For example - let x = [10,20,30];let y = [10,20,30];let z = x;let xyEqual = (x === y); // falselet xzEqual = (x === z); // true In the above example, even if x and y have the same values but their shallow comparison will return false since their references are different. So if we apply this on the pure component - The pure component implements shouldComponentUpdate method with a shallow comparison of props and state. It compares the previous props with the current props and previous state with the current state, and if there is a difference, the component will re-render otherwise it will not. In our example, we have compared the name prop which is of a primitive type (string). So in every 3 seconds when the pure component receives the name prop with updated value, it shallow compares the new value with the previous one which is the same as before and that is the reason why it doesn't render. Now the question arises, Why use pure components? Since pure components prevent unnecessary renders, it will give a performance boost to our application. Conclusion - PureComponent class is used to create Pure Components. It implements shouldComponentUpdate method and shallow compares the props and the state. If there is no difference, the component will not be re-rendered. Pure Components boosts up the performance by preventing the unnecessary renders of the component. It is not a good idea to mutate the state when using pure components. Always return a new object that reflects a new state. It is always advisable to use regular components over pure components.\n  \n\n\n      \n  \n\n  \n    \n    \n      \n    \n            25\n      \n    \n\n    \n      \n          \n            3 comments\n          \n      \n    \n\n\n\n\n  \n\n          \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                  \n    \n    \n                \n  \n    Activity\n  \n  \n  \n\n\n    \n      2,020 followers\n    \n\n\n  \n      \n        \n              \n    \n      \n    \n      \n\n  \n    \n    \n        \n          \n\n    Looking for following profiles\n\n1.
